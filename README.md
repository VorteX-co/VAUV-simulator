Installation
------

```sh
   colcon build --packages-up-to plankton
```

--------
Usage
------
Starting an underwater environment:-

```sh
  ros2 launch uuv_gazebo_worlds ocean_waves.launch
```

Uploading SWIFT AUV:-

```sh
ros2 launch swift_description upload_swift.launch mode:=default x:=0 y:=0 z:=-1 namespace:=swift
```

Starting dynamic positioning PID controller:-

```sh
ros2 launch uuv_trajectory_control rov_pid_controller.launch uuv_name:=swift
```

Sending waypoints to the DP controller to follow:-

```sh
ros2 launch uuv_control_utils send_waypoints_file.launch uuv_name:=swift
```

For creating new underwater vehicle's description package run the following command within the simulator folder:-

```sh
ros2 run uuv_assistants create_new_robot_model --robot_name <ROBOT_NAME>
```
